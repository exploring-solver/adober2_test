Building on earlier findings that show the relationship between increased upfront capital costs for various energy efficiency measures and the reduction in life cycle costs due to decreased operating expenses, the authors now hav e data from improved modeling methods and field data collection that further support the value of including these basic energy efficiency measures in low -income housing units in developing countries, including those with moderate climates.
