# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Core Methodology

Our solution implements a **semantic relevance ranking system** that combines natural language processing with machine learning to intelligently extract and prioritize document sections based on user context.

## Three-Stage Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1: Intelligent Section Detection
We employ a multi-faceted approach to identify document sections beyond simple text extraction:

**Pattern Recognition**: Multiple regex patterns detect various heading formats (numbered, roman numerals, title case, ALL CAPS). This handles diverse document structures from academic papers to business reports.

**Contextual Analysis**: Each potential section is analyzed for linguistic patterns using spaCy's NLP capabilities. We examine sentence structure, part-of-speech patterns, and document positioning to distinguish true headings from body text.

**Heuristic Filtering**: Advanced filtering removes false positives like figure captions, table headers, and footnote references while preserving genuine section boundaries.

### Stage 2: Semantic Relevance Scoring
The core innovation lies in our **dual-embedding similarity approach**:

**Persona-Job Embedding**: We create separate semantic embeddings for the user's persona (role/expertise) and their specific job-to-be-done using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer model. This captures both the user's background knowledge and immediate objectives.

**Section Contextualization**: Each section combines its title with surrounding context (10 lines) to create rich semantic representations that capture not just topic but also depth and treatment style.

**Weighted Relevance Calculation**: Our scoring algorithm weighs job relevance at 70% and persona relevance at 30%, reflecting that immediate task needs typically outweigh general expertise matching.

### Stage 3: Hierarchical Content Extraction
**Multi-level Analysis**: Beyond section ranking, we extract refined subsections using intelligent sentence grouping. This provides granular insights while maintaining document structure.

**Quality Assurance**: Multiple validation layers ensure extracted content meets minimum length requirements and semantic coherence standards.

## Key Differentiators

**Cross-Domain Adaptability**: Unlike hardcoded extraction rules, our semantic approach generalizes across document types - from research papers to financial reports to educational materials.

**Context-Aware Prioritization**: The system understands that a "Travel Planner" planning a college trip needs different information from the same French tourism documents than a "Cultural Researcher" studying regional traditions.

**Scalable Architecture**: Processes multiple documents simultaneously while maintaining memory efficiency and CPU-only operation constraints.

This approach enables truly intelligent document analysis that goes beyond keyword matching to understand semantic relevance and user intent.
